# Current Status
Not all core features are implemented currently. It is still being worked on!

# Planned features
After all core functionality is implemented, the following features are planned

* Graphs representing expense vs income ratios.
* Ability to save the budget to a file.
* Ability to export budget to an Excel document.
* Arbitrary expense categories.

Some of these features may require refactoring. The current GUI is intended to be temporary. After the core logic is implemented, it is planned to be refactored to use event driven updates to decouple the GUI.
